                        Pippa is a kind streamer who holds high passion for the art of Vtubing.<br>
                        She streamed and published many videos talking about various subjects concerning about the community, or in order to give advice to anyone wanting to evolve as a VTuber.<br>
                        She loves Vtuber culture, but still, she is defined her honesty and sincerity, and thus also not afraid to point out its flaws and deficiencies.<br>
                        She is usually speaking with a sweet tone. However, she may swear even in the middle of a common phrase.<br> Moreover, when she gets angry or excited, Pippa always quickly starts to swear more than usual while speaking with a quaky loud voice.<br>
                        She seems to be paranoid, and is often seen as a conspiracy theorist who believes that some mass shootings are false flags caused by the United States government as a pretense to repeal the Second Amendment so that it's citizens are easier to oppress.<br> She has a bias against city-dwellers, and holds a strong preference for country life.<br>
                        She is often considered Sakana's biggest headache with her antics and subversive content,<br> often talking about the darker parts of the internet. She constantly pushes the boundaries set by management, and enjoys trolling and messing with people,<br> but in turn they also enjoy trolling and messing with her.
                        Despite all her edginess, however, behind the scenes Pippa is actually an intelligent, thoughtful and empathic soul.<br> She is well known for roasting her peers, her company, her own fanbase and anything else she feels like,<br> but behind the scenes she genuinely wants to express support for them. Her tangents and zatsudans can get profound,<br> delving into various topics like philosophy and dealing with psychological problems.<br> In her original song, she herself admitted that she used to want to become somebody awesome in this world, but her fate went wrong.<br> However, it was in Vtubing wherein she found a space where she can belong,<br> to express her own identity and talents. She is a cynic, yes, but she climbed out of it,<br> and now she developed into a more assertive, confident and friendly personality using her experience to help others.
                        Pippa, as well as her Capippalist followers,do not shy away from adversity, ostracism, and controversy.<br> Thus they have adopted this phrase as their motto: I am Cringe, but I am Free<br>
